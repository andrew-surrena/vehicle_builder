# Vehicle Builder

## Description

Welcome to the Vehicle Builder App. With this app, you'll be able to enter basic vehicle information, store it to a list of vehicles, and choose from a list of actions to perform with your vehicle.

While working on this project, I was able to practice TypeScript in addition to the Inquirer module. In using Type Script, I was able to practice using such features as Interfaces, Classes, Inheritence, Polymorphism, and Composition.
